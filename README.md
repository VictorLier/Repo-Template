# Template inizialization
Welcome to your new repository. *First* let's create some rules for the repo.

## Branch protection
To ensure code quality, branch protection rules are used to make sure PRs are checked before being merged. To enable protection, in GitHub, go to:
`Settings - Rules - Rulesets`

Click `New ruleset` and choose `Import a ruleset`. Select the `.github/workflows/ruleset.json` file.
